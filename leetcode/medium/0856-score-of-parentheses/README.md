# Score of Parentheses

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given a balanced parentheses string `s`, return  *the  **score**  of the string*.

The  **score**  of a balanced parentheses string is based on the following rule:

- "()" has score 1.
- AB has score A + B, where A and B are balanced parentheses strings.
- (A) has score 2 * A, where A is a balanced parentheses string.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: s = "()"
Output: 1

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: s = "(())"
Output: 2

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: s = "()()"
Output: 2

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 2 <= s.length <= 50
- s consists of only '(' and ')'.
- s is a balanced parentheses string.

            if (s[i] == '(') {
                ++depth;
            } else {
                --depth;
                if (s[i - 1] == '(') {
                    score += 1 << depth;
                }
            }
        }
        return score;
    }
};
