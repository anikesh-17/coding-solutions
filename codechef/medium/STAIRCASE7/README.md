## Problem

### Staircase Edits

An array $A$ is called a staircase if it satisfies the following condition:

- $A_i - A_{i - 1} = 1$ for all $2 \le i \le |A|$

You are given an array $A$ of $N$ integers, which you want to convert into a staircase array. In one operation, you can change the value of any one position in the array $A$ to any integer you want.

Find the minimum number of edits needed to transform the array $A$ into a staircase.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of multiple lines of input. The first line contains one integer $N$. The second line contains $N$ integers - $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the minimum edits to make the array $A$ a staircase.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10^4$
- $2 \le N \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
- $1 \le A_i \le N$
- The sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.
### Sample 1:

```
3
4
1 2 3 4
4
4 4 1 2
3
3 2 1

```

```
0
2
2
```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case 1:**  The array is already a staircase.

 **Test Case 2:**  You can change $A_1$ and $A_2$ to get the array $[-1, 0, 1, 2]$.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int t;
	cin >> t;
	while(t--){
	    int x,y;
	    cin >> x >> y;
	    cout << abs(x-y) << endl;
	}

}
