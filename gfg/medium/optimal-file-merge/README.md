# Optimal File Merge

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given an integer array  **files[]**, where  **files[i]**  represents the size of the i-th file, merge all the files into a single file with the minimum total computation cost.

The cost of merging two files of sizes  **x** and  **y** is  **x + y**. After merging, a new file of size **x + y**  is created, which can be merged further with other files.

Return the minimum total cost required to merge all the files.

 **Note:**  It is guaranteed that the minimum total computation cost fits within a 32-bit signed integer.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: files[] = [3, 2, 4]
Output: 14
Explanation: There are different ways to combine these files. Optimal method is given below:

```

```
Input: files[] = [2, 3, 6, 5, 7, 4]
Output: 68
Explanation: There are different ways to combine these files. Optimal method is given below:

```cpp
class Solution {
	public:
	int minComputation(vector<int> &files) {
		// code here
		priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq(files.begin(), files.end());
		long long cost = 0;
		while (pq.size() > 1) {
			int a = pq.top(); pq.pop();
			int b = pq.top(); pq.pop();
			cost += a + b;
			pq.push(a + b);
		}
		return (int)cost;
	}
};

```
