# Any Duplicate Within K Distance

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an array of integers,  **arr[]**  and an integer  **k**, check whether there exist two distinct indices i and j such that arr[i] is equal to arr[j] and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 5, 4, 5, 1], k = 3
Output: true
Explanation: The element 5 occurs at indices 1 and 3. Their distance is |3 - 1| = 2, which is less than or equal to k.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [10, 2, 3, 4, 10, 5], k = 3
Output: false
Explanation: The element 10 occurs at indices 0 and 4. Their distance is |4 - 0| = 4, which is greater than k. Hence, no duplicate exists within the given distance.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [5, 1, 3, 2, 4], k = 3
Output: false
Explanation: All elements are distinct, so no duplicate exists.
```

```cpp
class Solution {
	public:
	bool checkWithinK(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
		// code here
		int n = arr.size();
		unordered_map<int, int>mpp;
		
		for (int i = 0; i<n; i++) {
			if (mpp.find(arr[i]) != mpp.end()) {
				if (i - mpp[arr[i]] <= k)
					return true;
			}
			mpp[arr[i]] = i;
		}
		
		return false;
	}
};

```
